# 🎉 Session Complete - SQL Migration + Smart Chat Interface

## ✅ What We Accomplished:

### 1. Migrated from Supabase to SQL (MySQL)

**Backend:**
- ✅ Configured MySQL database connection with SQLAlchemy
- ✅ Created database models (`db_models.py`) for all tables
- ✅ Created MySQL API router (`mysql_api.py`) for CRUD operations
- ✅ Updated configuration to use MySQL instead of Supabase

**Frontend:**
- ✅ Updated all services to use backend API instead of Supabase
- ✅ Updated file upload to use local storage
- ✅ Fixed all database calls to use MySQL backend

**Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Set up Docker Compose with MySQL + Backend
- ✅ Created Dockerfile for backend
- ✅ MySQL running on port 13306 (to avoid conflicts)
- ✅ Backend running on port 8000
- ✅ All data now stored locally (MySQL + file system)

### 2. Built Conversational Curriculum Designer

**Smart Chat Interface:**
- ✅ Chat-based curriculum building
- ✅ Adapts to user style (guided OR free-form)
- ✅ Real-time clause selection panel
- ✅ Live curriculum preview
- ✅ Quick suggestion buttons

**Professional Instructional Design:**
- ✅ Created `InstructionalDesigner` service
- ✅ Implements Bloom's Taxonomy
- ✅ Follows ADDIE model
- ✅ Applies 70-20-10 learning model
- ✅ Designs proper module structure
- ✅ Creates SMART learning objectives
- ✅ Designs engaging activities
- ✅ Includes appropriate assessments

## 📊 Current System Architecture:

```
Frontend (React/Vite)
  ↓
Backend API (FastAPI) [Docker]
  ↓
MySQL Database [Docker]
  ↓
Local File Storage
```

**No cloud dependencies - everything runs on your computer!**

## 🗄️ Database Tables (MySQL):

1. **rfps** - Uploaded RFP documents
2. **clauses** - Parsed requirements from RFPs
3. **standards** - Training standards and compliance docs
4. **curricula** - Generated curricula
5. **curriculum_modules** - Module details
6. **outputs** - Generated files (PPT, PDFs, etc.)
7. **scenarios** - Practice scenarios

## 🚀 How to Run Your App:

### Terminal 1 - Docker (MySQL + Backend):
```bash
cd C:\Users\gerog\Documents\WSIB
docker-compose up
```

### Terminal 2 - Frontend:
```bash
cd C:\Users\gerog\Documents\WSIB\frontend
npm run dev
```

### Browser:
```
http://localhost:5173
```

## 🎯 New Workflow for Creating Curricula:

### Old Way (Before):
1. Upload RFP
2. Click "Generate Curriculum" button
3. ❌ Could only create 1 curriculum
4. ❌ No customization
5. ❌ No control over what's included

### New Way (Chat Interface):
1. Upload RFP
2. Click on RFP in dashboard
3. **Chat with AI about what you want**
4. AI asks smart questions
5. Clauses auto-selected (shown in real-time)
6. Preview builds as you chat
7. Click "Save" when satisfied
8. ✅ Create multiple different curricula from same RFP!

## 🎓 Example: Creating 3 Curricula from 1 RFP

**Your Use Case:**

1. **Curriculum #1: Basic CPR (8 hours)**
   - Chat: "Create 8-hour basic CPR for general public"
   - AI builds it
   - Save to database

2. **Curriculum #2: Advanced First Aid (16 hours)**
   - Go back to RFP
   - Start fresh chat
   - Chat: "Create 16-hour advanced first aid for healthcare workers"
   - AI builds different curriculum
   - Save to database

3. **Curriculum #3: Instructor Training (24 hours)**
   - Start new chat
   - Chat: "Create 24-hour instructor certification course"
   - AI builds it
   - Save to database

All 3 linked to same RFP, all stored in MySQL!

## 🔍 Check Your Data:

### MySQL Database:
```bash
docker-compose exec mysql mysql -uroot -proot123 gta_cpr_curriculum

# Then run:
SHOW TABLES;
SELECT * FROM curricula;
SELECT * FROM curriculum_modules;
```

### Files:
```bash
docker-compose exec backend ls /app/local_storage/rfp-uploads/
```
