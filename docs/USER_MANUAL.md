## Introduction

### What is the WSIB Curriculum Designer?

The WSIB Curriculum Designer is a smart tool that helps you create professional training curricula from Request for Proposals (RFPs). Think of it as your intelligent assistant that:

- **Reads RFP documents** - Automatically understands what the RFP is asking for
- **Creates professional curricula** - Designs courses using teaching best practices
- **Generates documents** - Makes PowerPoints, manuals, tests, and more
- **Saves everything** - All your work is safely stored on your computer

### Who is this for?

- Curriculum designers creating training programs
- Training managers responding to RFPs
- Instructional designers building courses
- Anyone who needs to turn RFP requirements into actual training curricula

### Key Benefits

‚úÖ **No subscriptions** - Everything runs on your computer, free forever
‚úÖ **AI-powered** - Chat naturally to create curricula
‚úÖ **Professional quality** - Uses Bloom's Taxonomy, ADDIE model, and more
‚úÖ **Time-saving** - What takes hours manually, takes minutes with chat
‚úÖ **Multiple curricula** - Create as many different courses as you need from one RFP

- **Description**: Brief note (optional)

**Step 4: Click "Upload and Parse RFP"**

The system will:
1. Upload your file ‚úÖ

3. Save everything to the database ‚úÖ

You'll see progress messages like:
- "Uploading file to server..."
- "Parsing RFP document..."
- "‚úì Parsed 355 clauses"

**What happens behind the scenes:**
- Your file is saved safely
- The system reads every requirement
- Each requirement is categorized (content, duration, assessment, etc.)
- All stored in your MySQL database

### Uploading Standards

Standards are like the "rules" you must follow (e.g., AHA CPR guidelines).

**Step 1: Click "Upload Standards"**

**Step 2: Select files**
- You can upload multiple files at once!
- Or upload a ZIP file with many documents

**Step 3: Click Upload**

## Creating Curricula

### Using the AI Chat

**Example Conversation:**

```
You: "I need to create an 8-hour CPR course for healthcare workers"

AI: "Excellent! What should we call this curriculum?"

You: "Healthcare CPR Certification - Basic Level"

AI: "Perfect! I've selected 145 MUST-HAVE requirements from the RFP.
     Ready to generate?"
     
You: "Yes"

AI: "‚ú® Curriculum Generated!
     - 6 modules
     - 8 hours total
     - Includes hands-on practice, assessments
     - Professional instructional design applied"
```

### What Gets Created

Your curriculum includes:

**Modules** - Organized chunks of content (e.g., Module 1: Introduction, Module 2: CPR Techniques)

Each module has:
- **Learning Objectives** - What students will be able to DO (using Bloom's Taxonomy)
- **Content Topics** - What you'll teach
- **Activities** - How you'll teach it:
  - Discussions (10%)
  - Demonstrations (30%)
  - Hands-on Practice (35% - most important!)
  - Assessments (15%)
  - Review (10%)
- **Duration** - Time for each part
- **Materials** - What you need (manikins, AEDs, etc.)

**Professional Design Principles Applied:**
- **Bloom's Taxonomy** - Learning progresses from basic (remember) to advanced (create)
- **ADDIE Model** - Industry-standard design process
- **70-20-10 Learning** - 70% practice, 20% instruction, 10% theory
- **Adult Learning** - Practical, scenario-based, relevant

### Creating Multiple Curricula from One RFP

If your RFP asks for 3 different courses:

**For Course 1:**
1. Chat: "Create 8-hour basic CPR for general public"
2. Follow conversation
3. Save curriculum

**For Course 2:**
1. Stay in AI Assistant (or come back)
2. Chat: "Now create 16-hour advanced first aid for healthcare workers"
3. AI starts fresh conversation
4. Save this curriculum too

**For Course 3:**
1. Chat: "Create 24-hour instructor certification course"
2. Save

All 3 are linked to the same RFP but are completely different curricula!

## Business Requirements Documents

### What is a BRD?

A Business Requirements Document extracts the "business needs" from your RFP. It organizes all requirements into a professional format that stakeholders can understand.

### How to Generate

You: "Generate a business requirements document"
AI: Creates BRD and shows it on the right panel
```

**Method 2: From BRD Page**
1. Click "Business Requirements" in menu
2. Find your RFP
3. Click "Generate BRD"

### What's in the BRD

- **Executive Summary** - High-level overview
- **Business Objectives** - What the organization wants to achieve
- **Functional Requirements** - What the system/training MUST do (labeled FR-1, FR-2, etc.)
- **Non-Functional Requirements** - Quality attributes (NFR-1, NFR-2, etc.)
- **Project Scope** - What's included and excluded
- **Stakeholders** - Who's involved
- **Success Criteria** - How to measure success
- **Constraints** - Limitations (budget, time, etc.)
