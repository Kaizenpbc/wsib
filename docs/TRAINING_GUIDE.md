## Demonstration Scripts

### Demo 1: First-Time User Flow

**Script for trainer:**

"Welcome! I'll show you how easy it is to create professional training curricula.

*[Click Dashboard]*

This is your home. You can see any RFPs you've uploaded.

*[Click Upload RFP]*

Let's upload a Request for Proposal. These are documents that tell us what training is needed.

*[Select file, fill form, upload]*

Watch as the system reads the document... See? It found 355 requirements automatically!

*[Click AI Assistant]*

Now here's where it gets interesting. This is your AI helper. Left side - you chat. Right side - your work appears.

*[Type: 'Create an 8-hour CPR course for healthcare workers']*

Just tell it what you want in plain English... The AI asks smart questions...

*[Follow conversation]*

Look at the right side - it's building your curriculum in real-time!

And when done, you have a complete professional curriculum ready to deliver."

### Demo 2: Power User Workflow

**Script:**

"For experienced users, you can give detailed instructions all at once.

*[Open AI Assistant]*

Instead of answering questions, you can say:

*[Type long instruction]*
'Create three courses from this RFP:
1. 8-hour basic CPR for general public
2. 16-hour advanced first aid for healthcare workers  
3. 24-hour instructor certification course

Start with the basic course, focus on adult and pediatric CPR, include AED training.'

*[Show AI response]*

See how it understood everything? It's creating the first course now...

This saves time when you know exactly what you need."

## Common Questions During Training

### Q: "What if I make a mistake?"

**A:** Just start a new conversation! Or correct the AI:
- "Actually, make it 16 hours, not 8"
- "Change the audience to paramedics"

### Q: "Can I save my chat conversation?"

**A:** The AI remembers your conversation while you're working. Once you save the curriculum, it's in the database. You can start fresh for the next project.

### Q: "How do I know if it used the right requirements?"

**A:** In the curriculum chat, you can see selected clauses in the right panel. The AI automatically selects MUST-HAVE requirements, and you can ask it to include more.

### Q: "What if the RFP asks for 5 different courses?"

**A:** No problem! Create them one at a time:
1. Chat to create course #1, save
2. Start new chat for course #2, save
3. Repeat for all 5

### Q: "Can I edit a curriculum after saving?"

**A:** Currently, you'd create a new version. Editing feature is planned for future updates.

### Q: "Where is my data?"

**A:** Everything is on your computer:
- Database: MySQL in Docker
- Files: `backend/local_storage/`
- It's safe even if you close the app!

## Troubleshooting During Training

### Issue: "I can't see my uploaded RFP"

**Solution:**
1. Check Dashboard
2. Look for parsing status
3. If error, re-upload
4. Check file format (PDF, DOC, DOCX, ZIP only)

### Issue: "Chat isn't responding"

**Solution:**
1. Check if backend is running
2. Refresh browser
3. Try clicking a suggestion button instead of typing
4. If still stuck, restart browser

### Issue: "Generated curriculum looks wrong"

**Solution:**
- This is normal! AI needs good instructions
- Try being more specific
- Answer AI's questions carefully
- You can create a new one anytime
