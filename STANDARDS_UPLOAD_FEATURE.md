1. Look at all uploaded standards
2. Use them as reference guidelines
3. Ensure curriculum aligns with uploaded compliance documents
4. Check requirements against standards

### Database Structure:
```sql
standards
├── id (UUID)
├── name (text)
├── description (text)
├── category (text)
├── tags (array)
├── requirements (JSON)
├── file_url (text) ← NEW!
├── file_name (text) ← NEW!
└── created_at (timestamp)
```
